## About
### How to Use the Mod
#### Keyboard:
-Changing caps lock on or off will cause the game to freeze for a second. -The keyboard has a paste button -Make sure to press the yellow "Enter" button when you're done

#### Server Codes:
-Server codes are just encoded IP addresses, and while it's not exactly easy to decode, I wouldn't share it with strangers that you don't trust.

####Usernames:
-Everyone in a server is named "Riptide Enjoyer", and in order to change that, you can either paste your name in the base Fusion nickname settings, or if you're on quest you need to use the keyboard in Riptide Settings.

#### Hosting Servers:
-In order to properly host a server, you need to port forward. On PC this is done mostly automatically, if your router supports it. On Quest, you need to port forward manually.

# YOU MUST PORT FORWARD ON PORT 7777 UDP
### How to use Riptide
-Go into the Fusion menu -Go to "Network Layer Manager" -Click on the target layer, and cycle until the target layer says "Riptide" -Restart your game

## Patch Notes:
### 1.0.1
-Updated Encoding and Decoding IPs to be "safer" (Still be careful)
+Codes are a decent amount longer
+Old codes will NOT WORK (UPDATE SERVER LISTINGS)
