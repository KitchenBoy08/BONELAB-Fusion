# FAQ

**Q: I entered the game and my arms + limbs are broken, and I can't move around.**

**A: Are you sure you're on patch 3? Double check, if that doesn't work try backing up your mods and uninstalling and reinstalling while on Patch 3.**

**Q: Is this supported on Standalone Quest/Quest 2?**

**A: Yes! If you're using Riptide, then the only extra step is to port forward. If you're using Steam, then make sure to have the Fusion Helper running on the same network as your quest on a PC somewhere, and also that steam is running on said PC**
