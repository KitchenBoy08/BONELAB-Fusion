# BONELAB TideFusion
## Networking
This mod utilizes both Steam and Peer 2 Peer networking and is available on both Quest and PCVR platforms.

## Modules
Fusion supports a system called "Modules". This allows other code mods to addon and sync their own events in Fusion.
Fusion also has an SDK for integrating features into Marrowâ„¢ SDK items, maps, and more.

## Marrow SDK Integration
NOTICE:
When using the integration, if you have the extended sdk installed, delete the "MarrowSDK" script that comes with the extended sdk.
It can be found in "Scripts/SLZ.Marrow.SDK/SLZ/Marrow/MarrowSDK".
The reason for this is that this is already included in the real sdk, and Fusion uses some values from it, causing it to get confused.

You can download the integration unity package from the Releases tab of this repository.
Alternatively, you can download the files raw at this link:
